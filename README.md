# ShutterStock-ready-AI-Image-Generator

This generates Images with Together AI, and auto formats the metadata information into a csv file ready to be uploaded to ShutterStock. It utilizes Flux 1.0 for the image generation, as well as Llama 3.3 for the prompt, and metadata generation.

To use:
**1. Obtain a Together AI API Key** (don't worry this program uses the free models of Flux and Llama 3.3)

**2. Replace the "REPLACE API KEY" with the key that's yours**

**3. Double Click run.bat (or just double click the python file idk if that acc works)**
